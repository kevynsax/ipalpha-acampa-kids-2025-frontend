 * Background "remove repeats" pass for individual free-text fields. On blur a
 * field hands its current value to the server (GLM 5.3 flash), which drops any
 * entry written twice and returns the cleaned text. It's best-effort and
 * silent: a failure or an unchanged answer does nothing.
 *
 * Usage: `const dedup = useFieldDedup({ token, busy });` then on a field's blur
 * call `dedup.run("emergencyContact", value, setValue)`. `dedup.busy("…")` is
 * true while that field's request is in flight (drives the pulsing background).
 *
 * Only one request per field runs at a time; a newer blur cancels the older.
 * `cancelAll()` aborts everything (call it before submit).
