/**
 * A room CARETAKER only sees the OTHER kids of their room (the ones under a
 * colleague's care) WHILE THE CAMP IS HAPPENING — mirrors the server's
 * `campActive` gate (services/scope.ts#camperVisibility, services/camp.ts).
 * The server stops sending those kids in its next snapshot once the camp is
 * over, but a phone that is offline at that instant would keep them in
 * localStorage. This hook purges them the moment the camp ends, so a
 * caretaker is left with only the kids under their own care (`caretakerId`).
 *
 * A HELPER has no camp gate (they get the room's kids the whole time), so
 * nothing is purged for them. Same for people whose scope is NOT the room
 * (medical team, organizers, score helpers): they keep every kid the server
 * sent, camp or not.
 *
 * @param enabled  the logged-in user is a team member (staff / health_staff)
 * @param phone    the logged-in user's phone (to find their staff record)
 * @param during   the camp is happening right now (campPhase#useCampTiming)
